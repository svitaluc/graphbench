# graph-db-benchmark

This project serves for running various benchmarks on various graph databases. Its motivation is to simplify
writing and running benchmark tests. It provides
a unified interface for the most common graph databases, so that running a benchmark would only require
writing one test and a definition of a database(s) to use.

It's a work in progress and any suggestions are welcomed.

## Usage

You can either run the jar file directly or you can use an Automatic Launcher. In both cases, the configuration
is set with configuration files placed in graphbench-run-${project.version}/conf. In the case of the Automatic
Launcher, the configuration possibilities are a bit wider.
First, both approaches are introduced, followed by configuration description.

* **jar file** - you can run directly the provided jar file in 
graph-db-benchmark\graphbench-run\target\graphbench-run-1.0-SNAPSHOT\graphbench-run-1.0-SNAPSHOT\graphbench-all-1.0-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar
* **Automatic Launcher** - you can set more repetitions of tests in various directories on different databases at once
and run such setting at once without a need to call the jar file with different configuration each time.

### Cofiguration

All the configurations are read from the various files in the _conf_ directory. There is a config for general settings
and then there are specific configs placed in corresponding directories.

#### config.properties

* _DATABASE_TYPE_ - type of database that must match one of supported databases listed in 
eu.profinit.manta.graphbench.core.db.product.GraphDBType. So far the supported databases are
    * JANUSGRAPH
    * TITAN
* _DATABASE_DIR_ - directory of a database storage - a place where the database will be stored. It's cleaned
each time before a new test is run.
* _TEST_TYPE_ - similarly to _DATABASE_TYPE_, a type of database must match one of tests listed in
eu.profinit.manta.graphbench.core.test.TestType. So far the supported tests are
    * BASIC_OPERATIONS
If you want to run your own test, see the section _Extensions - Add Your Own Test or a Database_.
* _DATASET_DIR_ - directory of a dataset. The supported data model is described in section _Data Model_. The data
can be generated by the project _data-generator_ which is described in a separate README file.

These are the basic settings. The _config.properties_ file contains more configurations that are all described
 inside the file.
 
#### janusgraph/janusgraph.properties

Standard JanusGraph properties that are described in 
[JanusGraph documentation](https://docs.janusgraph.org/basics/configuration-reference/).
The properties defined in this file are all used for the JanusGraph configuration if the JanusGraph
database is used.

#### titan/titan.properties

Standard Titan properties that are described in 
[Titan documentation](http://titan.thinkaurelius.com/wikidoc/0.4.4/Graph-Configuration.html).
Note, that the option _TITAN_ has the version 0.4.4.
The properties defined in this file are all used for the Titan configuration if the Titan
database is used.

#### cassandra
The cassandra directory contains several yaml files that are used based on a Cassandra version 
that is required by given database. The file serves as a standard Cassandra yaml configuration
described at [its documentation](https://docs.datastax.com/en/archived/cassandra/3.0/cassandra/configuration/configCassandra_yaml.html).

## Data Model

So far, the data model expects three types of data stored in separate csv files, where each row
represents one record of an item (vertex/edge/edge attribute).
* _vertex_ - each vertex record is expected to contain information about its id, parent id and name.
Optionally a description can be included.
* _edge_ - each edge record is expected to contain information about its id, starting vertex and
ending vertex. Optionally a type information can be included.
* _edge attribute_ -  The edge attribute represents a property of an edge to be stored as an item of its 
properties set. Each edge-attribute record is expected to contain information about an edge id
to which the attribute belongs, the name of the attribute and the value of the attribute.

In all the cases, the column indices of individual data information are set in the _config.properties_
file. 

## Project description

The project is divided into following modules
* `data-generator` - this module is actually rather a separate project that serves for generating
data as an input for the graphbench project. It contains its separate README file as well.
* `graphbench-all` - contains the main method which starts the whole application and a database factory.
* `graphbench-backend` - contains necessary implementations for storage backends (such as Cassandra)
that can be necessary for some graph database products (such as Titan/JanusGraph).
* `graphbench-core` - contains all general logic and connectivity interfaces. It includes general
interfaces for a graph database, general handling of property files and csv files, dataset handling,
general test interfaces and others.
* `graphbench-janusgraph` - contains implementation for the JanusGraph.
* `graphbench-run` - this module has two main purposes
    * it assembles the whole project together, creating the final product of a runnable jar file
    _graphbench.jar_. 
* `graphbench-tinkerpop2` - contains implementation for the TinkerPop framework, version 2. 
* `graphbench-tinkerpop3` - contains implementation for the TinkerPop framework, version 3. 
* `graphbench-titan` - contain implementation for the Titan, version 0.4.4 (the last version
supporting Persistit storage backend).
